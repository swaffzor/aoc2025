A mathematical graph is a set of nodes and edges. The nodes (also called vertices or objects) are connected together by the edges (also called links or connections or arrows or arcs). For any graph we need to know two things:

1) Set of nodes in the graph
2) Set of edges from each node


G-----A-----B-----F
      |     |     |
      D-----C-----E

What does the above graph look like?

Set of nodes: A B C D E F G
Set of edges from each node:
A: A→B, A→D, A→G
B: B→A, B→C, B→F
C: C→B, C→D, C→E
D: D→C, D→A
E: E→C, E→F
F: F→B, F→E
G: G→A

Graph search algorithms don’t really “understand” the layout or properties of a grid. They only understand the connectivity.
